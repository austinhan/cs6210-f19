You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

Consider $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}, b \in \bbR^n$ with $A$ symmetric
and $b$ not an eigenvector, and define
\[
  \phi(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x - x^T b.
\]
We wish to minimize $\phi$ subject to the constraint $x^T x = 1$,
via the Lagrangian
\[
  L(x,\mu) = \frac{1}{2} x^T A x - x^T b - \frac{\mu}{2} (x^T x - 1).
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Express $x$ at a stationary point in terms
  of $A$, $b$, and $\mu$.
\item Argue that the condition $\|x\|^2 = 1$, given the expression
  from the previous step, implies
  singularity of the matrix
  \[
    \begin{bmatrix} (A-\mu I)^2 & b \\ b^T & 1 \end{bmatrix}
  \]
\item
  Eliminating the $z$ variable in
  \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
      (A-\mu I)^2 & b \\
      b^T & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix} y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = 0,
  \]
  show that $\mu$ satsifies the quadratic eigenvalue problem
  \[
    \left[ (A^2-bb^T) - 2 \mu A + \mu^2 I \right] y = 0.
  \]
  Solving via {\tt polyeig} gives
  us all possible $\mu$ in $O(n^3)$ time.
\item
  At the constrained minimizer, we must satisfy that
  $v^T (A-\mu I) v$ is positive for all $v$ s.t.~$v^T x = 0$.
  Argue that this implies $\mu < \lambda_2(A)$, where $\lambda_2(A)$
  is the second smallest eigenvalue of $A$.
\item
  Following the divide-and-conquer idea and the argument
  from the previous step, argue that $\phi$
  has no more than three constrained minimizers.
\item
  Write a code to solve the problem, with the interface
  {\tt hw6solve(A, b)} (returning the vector {\tt x}).
  Please also write a test case to sanity check your solver!
\end{enumerate}
