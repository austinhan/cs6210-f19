Just fill in the course evaluation!  The grading rubric has room for
nine HW assignments --- finishing the course eval counts toward your
participation score.  Note that I can see whether you completed the
evaluation or not, but nothing about what the evaluation contains.

TThe university likes to see general participation in course
evaluations.  But I'd also be happy to get an email with comments
about things that you liked or disliked about the course (or things
that you think might be done better next time around).

Now is also a good time to ssend me email with anything you'd
particularly like to hear about in the review lecture next Friday.
