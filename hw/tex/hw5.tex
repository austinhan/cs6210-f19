You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Tree falling}
The code {\tt tree\_solve} in the repository computes the solution to
$Ax = b$ where $A$ is a tree-structured symmetric positive definite
matrix.  Rewrite the reference code to run in $O(n)$ time.

\paragraph*{2: Remove a row}
Suppose $A \in \bbR^{m \times n}$ is decomposed as
\[
  A = \begin{bmatrix} A_1 \\ a_2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
  A_1 \in \bbR^{(m-1) \times n}, a_2 \in \bbR^{1 \times n}
\]
and both $A$ and $A_1$ are rank $n$.
Suppose we have an economy QR of $A$, show how to compute
$\hat{x} = A_1^\dagger b_1$ in $O(n^2)$ time (no code is needed
for this problem, just give the idea).

\paragraph*{3: Pesky probability}
Supposing $Z$ is a standard normal random variable, find the degree 8
polynomial $p(z)$ that minimizes
\[
  \phi(p) = E_Z[(p(Z)-\cos(Z))^2].
\]
What is the optimal value of $\phi$?  Please use the Gauss-Hermite
quadrature code included in the repository ({\tt gausshq.m} and
{\tt gausshq.jl}) to compute $E_Z[f(Z)]$ for any $f$ appearing in your
computations.
