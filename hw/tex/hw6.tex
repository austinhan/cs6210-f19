You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Contrary conditioning}
Given a scalar $C > 1$, find $A \in \bbR^{2 \times 2}$ for which the
eigenvalues are both one but $\kappa_2(A) \geq C$.

\paragraph*{2: Interesting identity}
Suppose $X, Y \in \bbR^{n \times k}$.  Show that if $\lambda \neq 0$
is an eigenvalue of $XY^T$ then
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  -\lambda I & X \\ Y^T & -I
\end{bmatrix}
\]
is singular.  Via this formulation, show $\lambda$ is also an
eigenvalue of $Y^T X$.

\paragraph*{3: Vector variations}
Differentiate the eigenvalue equation $Ax = \lambda x$ subject
to a constraint $l^* x = 1$ in order to write a linear system
for the derivative of $x$ and $\lambda$ under a small change to $A$.
